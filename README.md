# RiceStudy

This was my first highschool bioinformatics project! I wanted to study the effect of ecological factors on the diversity of genotypes, phenotypes, and evolutionary relationships of rice species, and to study phenotypes, I decided to use cladograms and NMDS analyses. 

## Cladogram
Cladograms are diagrams that group species based on synapomorphies, shared ancestral or derived characteristics, and identified through genetic or morphological data; organisms are drawn as branching nodes with points of divergence indicating speciation events. Branch arrangement reflects evolutionary history, with closely related organisms grouped on the same branch. This cladogram was created using the R package ‘ape’.

## NMDS Analysis
Non-metric multidimensional scaling (NMDS) analysis is a tool used in ecological research for comparing and visualizing the composition of different communities. NMDS uses rank orders, making it versatile for many types of ecological data. Its primary goal is to condense information from multiple variables, allowing for easier interpretation of differences. This NMDS analysis was performed in R using the ‘vegan’ package.
